# Investment Comparison Tool
In the last 2-3 years i've spent a lot of time to understand investing better. I built this tool for myself to see if my investments could be improved upon. In short, if i would have placed the same amount of money in a different stock or crypto for example, would i have done better?

This tool helps me check so I can learn for the future.

It's open source and in-browser (using local storage), meaning your investment data stays private in your browser between you and your browser (yourself). Everything is in 1 html file only. Lastly, in order to get stock and crypto prices, it does use 2 api's (Twelve Data & Alpha Vantage)

All you have to do is add your investments, update the current value of them as of today and then sync other stock and crypto prices via the "compare investments" button and see the data table and graphs.

Feel free to copy the HTML and use it in any way fit.
