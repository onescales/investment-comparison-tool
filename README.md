# Investment Comparison Tool
I built this tool for myself to see if my investments (which are positive) could be improved upon. For example, even though I bought S&P 500 stock that went over 20% up in 2024, I wanted to see if investing the same amount in another stock or crypto might have done better. This tool helps me check so I can learn for the future.

I made it open source and in-browser (using local storage), so everything stays between you and yourself. It does use APIs to read stock and crypto prices, but any data you upload is yours and remains private.

All you have to do is add your investments, update the current price over time, and then sync other stock and crypto prices to see how you would have done.

Feel free to copy the HTML and use it.

Just get a free API key from X and Y, and you can start.
